Hello, I go by Lanceback on GitHub. I'm a decent web developer, a just-about-ok game developer, a low level IT worker, a pretty good drone pilot, a recent robotics enthusiast, and a wannabe hac- I mean Cybersecurity Professional.

I'm pretty good at python, HTML, javascript, CSS, C, and bash. I'm ok at GO, just about capable with perl, and learning Rust.

I've also been known to play with autonomous aircraft on occasion. 

Currently in College.
