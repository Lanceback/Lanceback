Hello, I go by Lanceback on GitHub. I'm a decent web developer, a just-about-ok game developer, a small business IT worker, a pretty good drone pilot, a recent robotics enthusiast, and a wannabe Cybersecurity Professional.

I'm pretty good at python, HTML, javascript, CSS, C, and bash. I'm ok at GO, just about capable with perl, and learning Rust.

I've also been known to play with autonomous aircraft on occasion. 

Currently in College.
