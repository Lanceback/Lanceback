Hello, I go by Lanceback on GitHub. I'm a decent web developer, a just-about-good game developer, a low level IT worker, a pretty good drone pilot, a recent robotics enthusiast, and a wannabe hac- I mean Cybersecurity Professional.

My current projects include:

A tank game I made years ago. It was made in blender game engine, which is no longer around so I have recreated it in Godot Game Engine. 
Making that first game sparked an interested in game development that has lasted till now.
It's not an amazing game, but tank games always seem to have an audience.

A ROBOT(!) officially named the Electronic Reconnaissance Ground Vehicle Version One.
Unofficially... well I have a really cool name for it that is hilariously 80's sci-fi and also perfectly fitting. If you want to know what it is, ask nicely.
I've been having fun adding circuits to it, tweaking the code a bit, and generally having fun with the idea making a robot in the first place.
I just need like... a couple million more and I can take over- I mean protect the world!


I'm pretty good at python, HTML (javascript and CSS as well), gdscript and bash. I'm ok at GO, and am just barely capable with C and perl.

I've also been known to play with autonomous aircraft on occasion.
