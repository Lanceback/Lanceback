Hello, I go by Lanceback on GitHub. I'm a novice hobbyist web and game developer with a job that also includes web development occasionally.

My current project is a tank game I made years ago. It was made in blender game engine, which is no longer included in blender. 
Making that first game sparked an interested in game development that has lasted till now.
I'm now re-making this game in Godot, bit of a learning curve.
I'm pretty good at python, HTML(along with it's companions, javascript and CSS), gdscript, bash, and am just barely capable with C.
