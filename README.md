Hello, I go by Lanceback on GitHub. I'm a novice hobbyist web and game developer with a job that also includes web development occasionally.

My current projects include:

A tank game I made years ago. It was made in blender game engine, which is no longer included in blender. 
Making that first game sparked an interested in game development that has lasted till now.
I'm now re-making this game in Godot, bit of a learning curve.

A ROBOT(!) officially named the Electronic Reconnaissance Ground Vehicle Version One (ERGVVO, Recon-Grnd-Vhcl-1, whatever else works).
Unofficially... well I have a really cool name for it that is hilariously 80's sci-fi and also perfectly fitting. If you want to know what it is, ask nicely.


I'm pretty good at python, HTML, javascript, CSS, gdscript and bash. I'm ok at GO, and am just barely capable with C and perl.

I've also been known to play with drones on occasion.
